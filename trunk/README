Welcome to Pranayama, a basic web app server written in Erlang.

The project home is at http://code.google.com/p/pranayama/.

Please see the LICENCE file.

Either you downloaded a release or the source itself.

===============================================================================
Release 
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The release form is not a standalone app - it requires that Erlang be installed;
however, Pranayama comes with the dependencies that it needs.

To install Pranayama with the default settings, simply sudo Install.sh; 
this will do the following:

@ Copy all the contents of lib/* to /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib; this
  includes any dependencies that Pranayama needs such as a specific
  version of the kernel.

@ Similarly, it copies releases/* to /usr/local/lib/erlang/releases. 

@ Copy the pranayama.conf file to /etc/.

 The defaults for running Pranayama are:

    port_num: 8888
    web_app_registration_process_name: pranayama_registrar
    receive_request_timeout_ms: 2000
    handle_request_timeout_ms: 2000
    log_directory: /var/log/pranayama 

 Please see pranayama.conf for an explanation of each; however
 the only param that you're likely to change is the port.

@ Copy pranayama.sh (the control script) to /usr/local/bin.

@ Create an empty log directory called pranayama in /var/log/.

Once installed, all that your web apps will need is this:
     
     -include_lib("pranayama/include/pranayama.hrl").

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see the options for the control script - pranayama.sh --
simply run it; in brief, you can use it to start the server
(as a daemon, or in console), stop it, and spy on it -
that is, connect a console to an already running instance.

In order to confirm that Pranayama is running properly,
simply go to http://localhost:8888/spy/ping.

===============================================================================
Source
===============================================================================
You need R12B-0 or higher.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any recent release of Erlang should work.
For development, you will need EUnit 2.0 (it is bundled with the release).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If you downloaded the source the layout should be as such:

./dev.sh 	
	 A control script intended for development: run it to see the options.

./doc/
./doc/edoc
	Initially should be empty; target directory for the doc task of dev.sh.

./doc/src
	Contains several edoc-related files.		

./ebin/ 
	Initially should only include pranayama.app; target build directory.

./etc/ 
	Initially contains only the latest release file (.rel) but is the target 
       	directory for created the boot scripts (with dev.sh).

./include/
	Should only contain two .hrl files.

./releases 
./releases/normal
./releases/standalone
	Initially the release subdirectories should be blank.

./src
	Contains all of the .erl files.
	

You can use the ./dev.sh script to do everything that you'll likely
need to do.

However, there is one kludge that I haven't been able to get around:
before you run the 'create_normal_release' task, you must
manually modify the ebin/pranayama.app file; see that file for
details. Once you finish the task, please change it back, otherwise
you'll get confused as to which conf file is being used.

As well, you may have to change the .rel file to reflect your
local versions of kernel and stdlib.

Enjoy.
