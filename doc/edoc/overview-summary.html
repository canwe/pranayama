<h1>Pranayama ~ Basic Web App Server</h1>
<p>Copyright © 2008 Sean A. Rasmussen</p>
<p><b>Version:</b> 0.1.0</p>
<p><b>Authors:</b> Sean A. Rasmussen (<a href="mailto:sean@erasmos.com"><tt>sean@erasmos.com</tt></a>).</p>
<p>	
Pranayama could be used as a  basic web app server; however,	
it produces no content on its own; it acts	
more like a router, in that it delegates	
the actual content generating to another,	
external erlang process which is the actual 'web app.</p>
	 
	<p>The general flow is as follows: </p>
	
	<p>1) The 'real' http request is translated into an erlang	
record (#http_request)</p>

	<p>2) From this #http_request it determines the correct delegate web app	
which will be responsible for generating the #http_response record. This	
delegate must be globally registered.</p>

	<p>3) The delegate sends back this #http_response to Pranayama,	
which translates it into the 'real' http response and 	
fires it back to the client.</p>
	
	<p>This application was created as an offshoot of another Erlang project
	- <a href="http://www.themockexchange.com" target="_top"><tt>http://www.themockexchange.com</tt></a> -  as	
well as being a deliberate learning task; I've been teaching myself	
Erlang for about a year, part time. </p>
	
	<p>The project is hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pranayama" target="_top"><tt>http://code.google.com/p/pranayama</tt></a>	
and released under GPL 2.</p>

	<p>This is my first foray into the Open Source world, so any feedback		
as this project or in regards to good OSS behavior is welcome.</p>

	<p>Here's a bird's eye view of the architecture:</p>

	

	<p><em>pranayama_app</em> is the launch point, starting the 
	only supervisor: <em>pranayama_sup</em> which in turn watches	
over the following:</p>

	<h4><a name="pranayama_conversationalist">pranayama_conversationalist</a></h4>
	
	<p>The connection manager which ensures that we have one and only	
one offered connection at a time; a connection is represented	
by a pranayama_conversation process.</p>

	<h4><a name="pranayama_registrar">pranayama_registrar</a></h4>
	
	<p>Responsible for keeping track of all	
registered web apps as well as permitting registration	
and deregistration.</p>
				     			     
	<h4><a name="pranayama_event_manager">pranayama_event_manager</a></h4>
	
	<p>Simple event manager which is 'supervised' by	
pranayama_event_manager_sup to ensure that all failed	
event handlers bounce back.</p>

	<h4><a name="pranayama_log">pranayama_log</a></h4>
	
	<p>An event handler which manages the general	
server log (as opposed to the access log).</p>
				     
	<h4><a name="pranayama_log_writer">pranayama_log_writer</a></h4>

	<p>Another event handler which maintains the access log (in an 	
Apache style format).</p>
				     
	<h4><a name="spy">spy</a></h4>

	The only embedded web app; useful for ensuring that the server
	is running as well getting an echo of your request; of course
	it serves as an example as well.
